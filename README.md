# SINF_Project(FEUP)


This projected is developed within the scope of the Sistemas de Informação course of MIEIC and aims to develop a web application for an online fruit store with no physical stores.
The customer should be allowed to access the product catalog, inquire inventory by location, track the status of its order and other additional functionalities among the usual shopping cart and purchase order registration.
For the development of this project, we will use the Primavera ERP software, creating an external auth layer, ensuring reliability and coherence of all data.
